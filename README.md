Using a component based architecture to write a decoupled and modular code. Using S.O.L.I.D principles and OOP. 

Using Zenject Dependency Injection Framework to inject dependencies during runtime. 

All the Data is managed with  scriptable objects which are injected during runtime to expose all the parameters like settings for designers.

All the dependencies are injected using interfaces so that theyâ€™re no dependency on any concrete classes. To make sure that code is decoupled and modular so that the game remains scalable and will have reusable code base.

Using System.Reflection to filter data for different types of Asteroids like (small/medium/big) and UFO (small UFO / big UFO) which has different attributes.
